# Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There!
# : a task oriented alarm clock
## Background
Good morning! *(I say as it's currently 11:07 PM)* I have fully realized as of late that I personally struggle with getting out of bed. More specifically, my problem lies within the fact that I have become too used to shutting off my alarm in my sleep. *Just move my phone across the other room,* you say? I have done so but because the simple motion of turning off the alarm is a mindless gesture, it's quite easy to just get up, turn it off, then crash right back into my bed returning to the deepest slumber. Essentially, I need to get myself to mentally wake up in order to start my day. Hence, I bring to you all this alarm clock project!
